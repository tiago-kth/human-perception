# What color is this musical excerpt?

Hej! Welcome to the repository of our project.

This project explores how a synesthetic experience related to music perception and color association varies across cultures, and whether music with more energetic expressions elicits richer color responses.

This project was carried out as part of the course DM2350 - Human Perception for Information Technology, under the orientation of Professor [Roberto Bresin](https://www.kth.se/profile/roberto).

Here you will find the code for the "survey", which was built with the Web Standards (HTML, vanilla CSS, vanilla JS). It has a touch of generative art in the sense that the initial background picture is different each time you load the page. You can access the survey (and maybe even fill it?) at https://tiago-kth.github.io/human-perception/. There's also a Portuguese version at https://tiago-kth.github.io/human-perception/br/.

You will also find the data, the data analysis code (using R) and the plots generated. They are all under the `R` folder.

If you have any questions, comments or whatever, please feel free to write to tiagombp@kth.se
